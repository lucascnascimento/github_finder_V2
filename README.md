# GitHub User Finder

This project is part of Brad's Traversy course "React Front to back 2019". It consists of a github client that allows the user to search for other users and see their github information, e.g. hireability, repos, bio information and etc.  All the data is fetched from the github API.

## How to run it

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## What I learned

* I had a first contact with React Router and Fragments
* First saw what prop drilling is and how it may affect code maintainability on larger projects
